If you are a game collector it is a joy to show and tell people about your game collection. Unfortunately, some of the games in the collect might have broken or beat up boxes. Cover art seems to go missing quite a bit and it really drags down the overall appearance of the rest of the collection. The good news is that you can solve those issues.

Last week, I found [reproduction Sega Saturn long box cases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBMRQJW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon last week and decided to pick some up to tidy up my game collection. I recently have picked up a few Sega Saturn games that either didn't have a case or had cases that were cracked, scratched, or broken (which is common). I also had a discs that were just floating around loose. With my trusty tape measure I figured out the dimensions to print out new front and back covers so that they fit in these cases. But since [the cover I found](http://www.thecoverproject.net/view.php?game_id=5803) was shopped for a DVD size case, I had to shop back in the spines correctly and split the single image into front and back images.

Here's the dimensions for anyone that's playing at home:

**Front:**
* Width: 5.00 inches
* Height: 8.00 inches

**Back:**
* Width: 6.865 inches
* Height: 8.00 inches

Here's how Battle Arena Toshinden Remix turned out with some before and after pics. Not too shabby for a cheap ass ink-jet printer.
