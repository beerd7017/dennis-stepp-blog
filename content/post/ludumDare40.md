Recently, I participated in [Ludum Dare 49](www.ldjam.com), a global game jam in which thousands of participants come together to pair up or fly solo to create a game from scratch. There are two different modes you can decide from: the *compo* (48 hours, solo) or the *jam* (72 hours, solo/team). For LD 40, I ended up working by myself mostly.

__Weeks Before LD39__

The weeks leading up LD40 the plan was to work with a couple other guys but everyone couldn't get time off work. So the day before LD40 started I decided I'd go it alone.
